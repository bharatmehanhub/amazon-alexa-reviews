# Amazon Alexa Ratings and Reviews

This repository is created to share my work on sentiment analysis of
amazon alexa reviews posted by customers.

# About the Data

This data set (amazon_alexa.tsv) consists of a around 3100 Amazon
customer reviews (input text), ratings (out of 5), review date and
variant of various amazon Alexa products like Alexa Echo, Echo dots,
Alexa Firesticks etc.

We will use this data to train our Machine for sentiment analysis.

# Problem Statement

We have two questions to answer here as below:
1. Predict the type of review each customer will post going forward. We
   will split our data into train and test data set.
2. Discover insights into words used in consumer reviews to assist with
   machine learning models.

# Solution

i) We will train our models for sentiment analysis and categorise the
reviews into positive and negative reviews. This will be implemented
using naive bayes and decision tree classifiers.  
ii) We will generate WordCloud to discover insights into words used in
consumer reviews to assist with machine learning models.
